## Challenge (April 4 - May-4, 2020)

Create a website inspired by: [this web theme](https://jumpstart.mediumra.re/index.html) (with all it’s pages and features)

Note: this is a paid theme, send all “buy”, “purchase”, or “support” links to dead links or link to the home page.

### The Challenge

- Code as many pages as you can during the one month timeframe
- Code as many features as you can during the one month timeframe
- If you finish every page and every feature, find another theme and pose it as an ‘add-on’ challenge to the group

### Options

- Use any frameworks or libraries you want
- You can use Angular / React / Vue / etc
- If you’d rather make a mobile app, go for it, you do you
- Use any web fonts or icons you want
- Use Bootstrap or jQuery if you want
- Skip any feature that “seems impossible”, you can always come back to it

### For extra bragging rights

- Limit the use of external convenance libraries
- Use industry standards (git, lint, testing, deployment)
- Ensure your site is mobile-responsive and passes the w3c checker
- Live-stream one or more of your coding sessions
- Pair program for some part of the development progress
- Make yourself available to assist others with code reviews or quick peer sessions if anyone is stuck
- Report your progress regularly in daily logs
- Finish everything - with the smallest download/network bandwidth usage possible

### Prefer Full Stack

- Store the content in a database and create an API for an admin interface to update the content and for the frontend to query content to populate on the various pages.

### Rules

- Do not use text, fonts, icons, images, colors, code or ANY asset from the original theme. You can inspect the code, but don’t copy it.
- This challenge is to create a web site “inspired by” this theme, NOT to make a direct clone, you may take extensive creative license to make it your own.
- Success is measured on how much of the site you can replicate in 30 days, so carefully weigh taking the time to implement any one feature against how many easier features you could implement in the same time.
- Publish your code in a git repository and make a working demo available
- If you are stuck, ask for help. No one here is mean about learning, we’d rather help you than have you silent and miserable

### “Win” conditions

- if you learned a bunch, you’re a winner
- most pages / features completed
- smallest deploy package that delivers all pages and features





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
